# Event-Gallery
This application for Android Devices made by Sergejs Maruks

I'm new to Android programming and Facebook api, but I'm learning a lot and working hard to achieve results.

Current status: Work in Progress (Just started)

About app: I took part in many events where everyone was taking photos on their smartphones.
I rarely took photos myself, because I always tried to use buget phones with "average cameras", but I always wanted to see these photos.
The problem is that I don't know these people, and I don't want to look for their social media to check photos (if they upload any). 
As a result, I can't see most of photos from events I attended.

I decided to make my own application that will give people an opportunity to share photos with all attendants even if they are not connected on any social media.


After creating some basic functionality I will also start working on WEB version of service.
