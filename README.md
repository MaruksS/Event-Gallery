# Event-Gallery
This application for Android Devices made by Sergejs Maruks

I'm new to Android programming and Facebook api, but I'm learning a lot and working hard to achieve results.

Current status: Work in Progress (Just started)

About app: I took part in many events where everyone was taking photos on their smartphones.
I rarely took photos myself, because I always tried to use buget phones with "average cameras", but I always wanted to see these photos.
The problem is that I don't know these people, and I don't want to look for their social media to check photos (if they upload any). 
As a result, I can't see most of photos from events I attended.

I decided to make my own application that will give people an opportunity to share photos with all attendants even if they are not connected on any social media.
Idea itself is very simple: User creates an Event (Facebook event can be used as a base). Event has it's own gallery.
To join event users can siply scan generated QR with an app or mark "Going" on a facebook event.

All photos shared here will be available for all attendants.
I plan to also add private sector in Each event, where you will be able to share photos only with your friends.

For example: Public event with 1000 people. 
You and your friends decided to take a photo here, but not to share it with all attendants, but only within your friends.
As a result the public pool of photos is available for all, but private only for you and your friends and everything is easy accessible

After creating some basic functionality I will also start working on WEB version of service.
